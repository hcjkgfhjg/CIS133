    <h1><center>Web Design Feedbacks</center></h1>
      <p>This is a really simple website and really easy to navigate. Three things I like about this website are:
        <ol>
            <li>Homepage downloads really fast, almost instantly</li>
            <li>Good use of basic design principles </li>
            <li>Navigation is easy, even for new users</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite the website being simple, there are a lot of things that could have been done better such as:
        <ol>
            <li>The header is not consistent for all the pages</li>
            <li>Only one picture shows the resort, the rest looks like just random pictures on the internet</li>
            <li>Doesn't look appealing to target audience, it looks too simple and not a lot of work was put into it</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>With that being said, there are a couple of things I can think of that might make the website looks more appealing.
        <ol>
            <li>Provide more pictures about the resort so your guests know what they're getting.</li>
            <li>Add animations to make navigating the website more fun and more interacting.</li>
            <li>Making sure everything is aligned on every webpages </li>
            <li>Add a "about us" page to have a better introduction instead of having the mission statement in the homepage</li>
        </ol>
        
      </p>
