            A Dog's Life was established in 2012 when our owner Prakesh retired from his day job.<br> Here at A Dog's Life, our mission
             is to make sure every dog looks beautiful leaving our salon.<br> Not only that, grooming your
              dogs can benefit them in many ways such as:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Improve your dog's hygene, making it less susceptible to bacteria and infection</li>
            <li>Trimming their nails can improve their posture and prevent bone deformation</li>
            <li>Trimmed coat can help them to shed less, have a healthier and shiny coat </li>
            <li>By grooming your dog regularly, we can detect any skin or health issue that might<br> have developed, 
                therefore preventing it from becoming more serious</li>          
        </ol>
        <p>
            Appointments at A Dog's Life fill up quickly, so we recommend calling in advance to reserve<br>
             a spot for your pet. We are open every day from 8 A.M to 6 P.M so give us a call and we'll glam your pet up!
